UoW coursework (ProgCalc)
Programs in both "ProgCal v1.0" and "ProgCal v2.0" directories are able to provide the required outputs mentioned on "testPlan_part1to5".
Both of these programs are my own work.

Difference between the two programs:

"ProgCal v1.0" program follows the naming conventions mentioned on the Coursework document. Please note that "20201222-ProgCal_1.py" can be used to launch all the subparts mentioned as "coursework-partn.py"

"ProgCal v2.0" is modularized in such a way that the functions are stored as modules and called when necessary. Please note that the ProgCal v2.0 can only be launched via "20201222-ProgCal_2.py".
